# MineOnline
Launch old versions of minecraft just as you remembered them, only without a browser.

## What is MineOnline?
MineOnline is a launcher for pre-release Minecraft versions capable of running web applets without a browser, and redirecting old web requests to a new API.

For example, if you wanted to play classic right now, you'd have no way to launch it without a lot of outdated vulnerable software and luck. And even if you pulled it off, you'd be running a stipped down version of the game, with no skins, no server authentication and no online map saving. MineOnline fixes this.

The program can also run regular desktop versions of the game, and even old launchers.

## How do I use MineOnline?
While you can use this launcher just to play applets offline, well It's called MineOnline for a reason.
The application was build for use with [my Minecraft API project](https://github.com/codieradical/Minecraft-API).
At the moment, there aren't any public hosts, so you'll have to localhost that project.
The launcher is pre-configured for localhosting, so once you've got an API instance up and running, launching the game is as simple as browsing for the jar and pressing play.

More to come soon.
